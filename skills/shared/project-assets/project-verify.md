# project — `verify` (lazy detail · NEW in v2.0.0)

Loaded by the router when the user runs `/atomic-skills:project verify`.

`verify` reconciles `.atomic-skills/` state against the actual repository — schema validity, branch coherence, scope coverage, orphaned files, completion drift (open entries that look done in the repo), and (when aiDeck is reachable) the dashboard's view of the same state. It is the single coherence command that did not exist before the unification: previously schema-validation (`validate-state`), drift (`scope-creep`), branch-match (default view), and aiDeck STATE_ERROR each lived in different places and the user had to run them separately.

---

## Contract

### Inputs
- **Implicit:** the `.atomic-skills/` tree in the CWD, the current git branch + working tree, and (optionally) a running aiDeck instance.
- **Optional args:**
  - `--fix` — apply the deterministic, safe repairs the read-only pass identifies (schema normalization via `src/normalize.js`, nothing else). Without `--fix`, `verify` is strictly read-only and mutates nothing.
  - `--slug <slug>` — scope the verification to one plan/initiative instead of the whole tree.

### Output
A sectioned report (PASS / WARN / FAIL per check) printed to the terminal, ending with an overall verdict line:
`VERIFY: <PASS | N warning(s) | N failure(s)>`.
Exit-style semantics for the agent: on any FAIL, do NOT silently continue into a mutating command in the same turn — surface the failures and let the user decide.

### Mutation policy
`verify` (no flag) is **READ-ONLY**. It runs checks and reports; it writes nothing. The ONLY mutation path is `verify --fix`, and even then it is restricted to the same deterministic normalization the default view's STATE_ERROR auto-repair performs (`src/normalize.js`): gate-status synonyms → `met`/`pending`, `references[]` `kind`/`label` backfill, missing required initiative arrays → `[]`. `--fix` NEVER touches plan files structurally, NEVER advances phases, NEVER closes tasks, NEVER edits the markdown body. Anything beyond normalization is reported as a finding for the user to resolve with the appropriate command (`migrate`, `re-ratify`, `detect-scope`, `phase-done`, …) — `verify` does not perform those itself.

---

## Checks (in order)

`verify` is a thin orchestrator over existing machinery. It does not re-implement any check; it wraps and reports them.

### 1. Schema validity (wraps `validate-state`)
- Run `npm run validate-state .atomic-skills/` (or `--slug`-scoped file paths).
- **PASS:** all files valid.
- **FAIL:** print the validator's errors verbatim. If `--fix` was passed, first run `src/normalize.js` on `.atomic-skills/` (resolve it the same 3-path way the default view does), then re-run `validate-state`. Report what normalization changed. If files still fail after normalization, the failure is structural (not drift) — report it and recommend `migrate <slug>` for legacy files or manual repair.
- **Failure message (no fix):** `FAIL schema: <file> — <validator message>. Run \`verify --fix\` for safe normalization, or \`migrate <slug>\` if legacy.`

### 2. Legacy detection (read-only)

Two independent legacy conditions, each recommending a different `migrate` mode.

**2a. Legacy SCHEMA** — for each entity file (flat `initiatives/*.md` + `plans/*.md` AND nested `projects/<id>/<slug>/{plan.md,phases/*.md}`), parse frontmatter; collect files where `schemaVersion` is absent.
- **WARN** per legacy-schema file: `WARN legacy-schema: <slug> has no schemaVersion. Run \`migrate <slug>\` before mutating it.`
- `--fix` does NOT migrate (schema migration requires the standalone-vs-in-plan decision — that is interactive, owned by `migrate`).

**2b. Legacy LAYOUT (R-MIG-19)** — detect the pre-unification FLAT tree: any `.atomic-skills/plans/*.md` or `.atomic-skills/initiatives/*.md` present (count `*.md` direct children; ignore `archive/`).
- **WARN** (default — the flat and nested trees coexist during the migration window): `WARN legacy-layout: <N> file(s) still in the flat plans//initiatives/ layout. Run \`project migrate\` to move them under projects/<id>/<slug>/.` — then list the flat files.
- A **pure nested tree** (only `projects/<id>/<slug>/...`, with no flat `plans/`/`initiatives/` `*.md`) → **no finding**.
- `--fix` does NOT perform the layout move: that is the irreversible copy-verify-delete cut-over owned by `migrate` (it needs a tar snapshot of the live state first — it is not reliably git-restorable). `verify` only flags it.

### 3. Branch match (read-only; wraps default-view branch logic)
- `branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`.
- Find active initiatives whose `branch:` equals the current branch.
- **PASS:** exactly one active initiative matches (or the user is on the plan's expected branch).
- **WARN:** zero matches → `WARN branch: no active initiative anchored to \`<branch>\`. You are working unanchored (Iron Law). Run \`status\` to disambiguate or open an initiative.`
- **WARN:** more than one match → `WARN branch: <N> active initiatives claim \`<branch>\`: <slugs>. Only one should be active per branch.`
- Also flag: an active plan whose `currentPhase` initiative `branch:` does not match the current branch → `WARN phase-branch: active plan \`<plan>\` currentPhase \`<id>\` is on branch \`<x>\`, you are on \`<branch>\`.`

### 4. Scope coverage (read-only; wraps `detect-scope` data, no write)
- For the active initiative that has a `scope.paths`, compare against recent git activity: run `npm run detect-scope -- --json --branch=<branch> --limit=20`.
- **WARN** when recent commits touch paths NOT covered by any `scope.paths` glob → `WARN scope: recent commits touch <paths> outside the initiative's declared scope. Run \`detect-scope\` to update, or this may be scope creep — see \`scope-creep\`.`
- Initiatives without `scope.paths` are skipped (scope is optional), not failed.

### 5. Orphan detection (read-only; layout-aware per R-ORCH-38)
Resolve every entity in BOTH layouts: flat (`plans/`, `initiatives/`) and nested (`projects/<id>/<slug>/{plan.md,phases/*.md}`). A phase initiative's parent is resolved within its own project folder first (nested `projects/<id>/<parentPlan>/plan.md`), then the flat `plans/<parentPlan>.md`.
- **Orphan initiative:** a phase initiative (nested `projects/<id>/<slug>/phases/*.md` or flat `initiatives/<slug>.md`) with `parentPlan: <p>` where no `plan.md` resolves for `<p>` in either layout (and the parent is not under an `archive/`). → `FAIL orphan: initiative \`<slug>\` references missing parent plan \`<p>\`.` A standalone initiative with NO `parentPlan` is not an orphan — it is a 1-phase plan (or, pre-migration, a flat standalone awaiting `migrate`).
- **Orphan phase reference:** a plan `currentPhase` / phase `dependsOn[]` id that no `phases[]` entry declares (use `src/transition.js`:`unknownDeps(plan)`). → `FAIL orphan: plan \`<plan>\` has dangling phase reference(s): <ids>.`
- **Stranded active:** an initiative with `status: active` under a plan phase whose `status` is `done`/`archived`. → `WARN stranded: initiative \`<slug>\` is active but its phase \`<id>\` is \`<status>\`. Run \`phase-reopen\` or \`archive\`.`
- **Untracked PROJECT-STATUS rows:** rows in `PROJECT-STATUS.md` whose slug has no matching file (or vice-versa). → `WARN index: PROJECT-STATUS.md is out of sync (<slug> listed but file missing / file present but unlisted).`
- `--fix` does NOT auto-resolve orphans (resolution is a judgement call: re-parent, archive, or delete). It only reports.

### 6. aiDeck coherence (read-only; only if aiDeck reachable)
- Reuse the ensure-aideck script from `{{ASSETS_PATH}}/project-view.md` to get `AIDECK_URL` and `STATE_ERROR` (this is the only place `verify` touches the AIDECK CONTRACT — it does not duplicate the domain string; it delegates to `project-view.md`).
- **PASS:** `AIDECK_URL` non-empty AND `STATE_ERROR` empty.
- **WARN:** `AIDECK_URL` empty → `WARN aideck: dashboard not running; skipped the live-state cross-check. Run \`atomic-skills install\` / \`status --browser\`.`
- **FAIL:** `STATE_ERROR` non-empty → `FAIL aideck: dashboard would render \`⊘ failed to load\` — <STATE_ERROR>. Run \`verify --fix\` (normalizes) or \`status --browser\` (auto-repairs + opens).`
- When `--fix` is passed and aiDeck reports a STATE_ERROR, run the same normalization as check 1's fix path, then re-check.

### 7. Completion drift (read-only; wraps `detect-completion`)
- Run `node scripts/detect-completion.js --json` (the deterministic, zero-token detector — `--project <id>` to disambiguate same-slug plans). It classifies each open task / pending criterion by a *changed-deliverable* signal (`output-exists` / `commit-ref`); a `verifier:`'s presence alone is never a signal, and `acceptance[]` prose is never parsed.
- **PASS:** `drift` is false — no open entry looks done in the repo.
- **WARN** (report-only): `WARN completion: <N> task(s)/gate(s) look done in the repo but are still open — run \`reconcile\`.` — then list each candidate's `kind`, `id`, and `evidence`.
- This check is **strictly report-only**, consistent with `verify`'s read-only contract. `verify --fix` is **NOT** extended to reconcile — closing tasks/gates is a judgement call (verifier-aware, GATE-R2-gated) owned by the `reconcile` verb. `--fix` stays schema-normalization only.

### 8. Phase review gate (read-only; G2 backward-compat surface)
- For each plan phase with `status: done`, check whether it carries a `reviewGate` block (the structured phase-done review outcome).
- **PASS:** every done phase carries a `reviewGate` (its honesty — `passed`⟹`at`, `skipped`⟹`reason` — is already HARD-enforced by `validate-state` GATE-R3 in check #1, so a malformed one surfaces there as a FAIL).
- **WARN** (report-only): `WARN review-gate: <N> done phase(s) carry no recorded review gate (closed before the gate existed, or review-code was never run) — <plan>/<phaseId>…`. This is the deterministic surface for the legacy/missed case that GATE-R3 deliberately tolerates (absent ≠ malformed); it never mutates and `--fix` does not backfill it (the review must actually run — `phase-done` / `review-due` is the only path that writes a truthful `reviewGate`).

## Red flags

- "verify can just auto-fix everything it finds" — NO. Only schema normalization is safe to auto-apply. Migration, scope edits, orphan resolution, and phase transitions are judgement calls that belong to their own commands. `--fix` is deliberately narrow.
- "verify failed schema but I'll mutate anyway" — NO. A schema FAIL means a downstream skill (or aiDeck) will reject the state. Fix before mutating.
- "no branch match is fine, I'll just edit" — that is exactly the Iron Law violation the router guards. Anchor first.
