# Inc0–Inc3 — implementation notes & verified ground-truth corrections

> **Status:** Inc0 + Inc1 + Inc2 + Inc3 DONE (2026-06-01). Branch `dogfood/self-host-migration`. **Next = Inc4** (No-Placeholders lint + SPEC gate). See the `## SESSION HANDOFF` block at the END of this file to resume. (Inc3 detail + pressure-test record: this file `## Inc3` + `08-inc3-pressure-tests.md`.)
> This file is the durable record of what was BUILT (vs. designed) and where the appendices' `file:line` claims drifted from the real code. A ground-truth verification sweep (6 parallel readers) ran before any code; its corrections are recorded here so future sessions trust the code, not the snapshot in 01/05.

## Ground-truth verification — 5 material corrections to the appendices

The design held up ~90% (decompose.js line numbers were byte-exact despite the file growing to 899 lines). Five places diverged enough to change the build:

1. **The strip-test is EASIER than the design feared (R-XAGENT-01).** `src/render.js:renderTemplate(content, vars, modules, ideId)` already does handlebars-like `{{#if ide.X}}` stripping, and `tests/compatibility.test.js` already imports it. No renderer needed to be built. **But** the host-orchestration tokens could NOT just be appended to the existing `FORBIDDEN_TERMS` lint — its heuristic is naive (first-occurrence only, 2-char `{{ }}` adjacency) and `TaskCreate(` is legitimately allowed *inside* an `ide.claude-code` block. The correct mechanism = render for gemini (strips CC blocks) then detect code-shaped tool refs in the remainder. Also `Monitor`/`Workflow` are common English words → detection uses call-shaped `Tool(` + backtick `` `Tool` `` only, never bare `\bword\b`.

2. **`ATOMIC_SKILLS_DIR` is wired NOWHERE (F-D1 / R-XAGENT-09).** grep across `src/` + `scripts/` = 0 hits. The "~75% already present, ~2-line decompose plumb" is true only in the weak sense that `normalizeStateDir(dir)`, `deriveProjectId(rootDir)`, and validate-state `collectTargets(args)` accept a *positional* root. None reads the env var, and `serve.js` never threads `rootDir` to `deriveProjectId` (both callsites @222/@295 hardcode `process.cwd()`). Adopting the named env-var mechanism touches ~4 files (decompose + normalize CLI + validate-state default + serve callsites), not 1. **See the dogfood-leak guardrail below.**

3. **The paranoid REDs (R-XAGENT-07) are mis-homed — the biggest reframe.** Verify-on-done verifier *execution* is **markdown prose** in `project-transitions.md` (`:178` query, `:192` test), not JS. `src/transition.js` is unrelated phase-graph code with no callable verifier-exec surface. So the REDs cannot live in `transition.test.js`. The only machine-testable enforcement is the **GATE-R2 met-invariant**, authored as an exported `checkMetInvariant()` in `scripts/validate-state.js` with the REDs in `validate-state.test.js`. This is exactly F-B2's "the invariant hoists into validate-state.js." **Inc1's real teeth = the JS met-invariant; the markdown un-stub is the (untestable-as-JS) prose half.** Decision (user-delegated, 2026-06-01): keep it in validate-state.js as an exported pure function — promote to `src/verify.js` only in Inc5 if the Mode-2 escalation judge proves it worth sharing (lossless move, real consumer in hand).

4. **`kind:test` needs a test-count field in TWO places.** The evidence shape (both the markdown block in `project-transitions.md` and the JSON `common.schema.json` evidence `$defs`) had only `exitCode` (shell) + `rowCount` (query). "0 tests collected ≠ met" requires a `testsCollected` field → it rides into the F-B5 0.2 delta.

5. **Schema + migration + met-invariant must land atomically.** A `schemaVersion:'0.2'` stamp fails validation until the `const "0.1" → enum ["0.1","0.2"]` change lands (existing test `validate-state.test.js` asserts wrong-version fails). And deleting the description-note workaround (F-B4) needs `task.evidence` in the schema first. Bonus simplifications confirmed: `schemaVersion` is defined once in `common.schema.json` (plan+initiative `$ref` it) → enum bump is a single-point edit; the F-B4 `$ref` must be `common.schema.json#/$defs/exitCriterion/properties/evidence` (the `/properties/` segment, or Ajv won't resolve).

## Inc0 — what was built (DONE)

- **R-XAGENT-08** — `scripts/validate-state.js` `kindFromPath`: added nested-layout inference (`phases/` → initiative as the LAST check in the loop; `plan.md` under a `projects/` ancestor → plan, after the loop). Flat walk byte-untouched. 6 new tests in `validate-state.test.js` (nested plan/phase/archive infer + validate, flat regression, no-kind error, plan.md-outside-projects guard).
- **R-XAGENT-01** — `tests/compatibility.test.js`: new describe `Cross-Agent Portability — host-orchestration ban + strip-test`. Per-skill byte-runnable-when-stripped (render for gemini → assert no `{{#if`/`{{/if}}`/`ide.claude-code` residue + no host-orchestration tool survives) + 3 synthetic discrimination tests (flags-outside-block / allows-inside-block / no-prose-false-positive). The old `FORBIDDEN_TERMS` lint is left untouched (appending these tokens there would wrongly ban legitimate in-CC-block usage). Banned set: `Workflow, TaskCreate/Update/Stop/Get/List/Output, Monitor, EnterWorktree/ExitWorktree, CronCreate/Delete/List`. Today every skill passes (zero usage) — the guardrail lands GREEN *before* orchestration tokens are introduced, which is the intent.

### R-XAGENT-02 — investigator write-capability probe (RECORDED; informs Inc3/Inc5 only, not v1)

A live probe of Gemini's `codebase_investigator` is not runnable from this environment; recording the load-bearing facts from `src/render.js` + tool semantics:

- **Claude Code:** `{{INVESTIGATOR_TOOL}}` → `Agent` (render.js:56). Agent/Task subagents CAN write files + use tools and spawn fresh-context. So a same-provider fresh isolated subagent is available for both the Mode-2 cheap-tier executor *and* the critic.
- **Gemini CLI:** `{{INVESTIGATOR_TOOL}}` → `codebase_investigator` (render.js:45) — a read-only code-investigation tool, not a general write-capable agent. Treat as **read-only** until proven otherwise.
- **Policy (confirms F-A2 / F-C1):** Mode-2 executor is **Codex-only on every host in v1** (the Anthropic subagent-executor tier is deferred entirely, not CC-gated). Critic provider is **tiered**: same-provider-fresh where host-isolated (Claude Code) → codex critic where isolation is unverified (Gemini) → solo-advisory refusal-to-gate otherwise. This is exactly why the R-XAGENT-01 strip-test (above) matters: the Codex lane + its `git worktree` primitive must survive the gemini strip.

### R-XAGENT-09 — state-root convention (RECORDED + guardrail; plumb deferred to Inc2 per F-D1)

- **Convention:** the four tools accept a positional/explicit state root today (`normalize <dir>`, `validate-state <dir|file…>`); `decompose.js materializeDecomposition` does NOT — it inlines the literal `.atomic-skills/` prefix at `:750` (plan) and `:803` (phase). The `opts.stateRoot` plumb is the SAME edit as the Inc2 `projects/<id>/<slug>/` path-emit, so it folds into Inc2 (not an Inc0 refactor). The named `ATOMIC_SKILLS_DIR` env var is currently wired nowhere; wiring it (decompose + normalize CLI + validate-state default + serve callsites) is an Inc2 task, not Inc0.
- **🚧 DOGFOOD-LEAK GUARDRAIL (load-bearing):** because `decompose.js` hardcodes the `.atomic-skills/` prefix and `.atomic-skills/` is gitignored (not git-restorable), **do NOT run `decompose materialize` against live state before the Inc2 stateRoot plumb lands.** Until then any materialize writes into the live tree, violating R-XAGENT-09's "live tree byte-frozen until D7." Inc0/Inc1 do not run materialize, so they are safe; the hazard is the migration dogfood (D1+), which must wait for Inc2.

## Inc1 — what was built (DONE)

Strict sequence (correction #5), each step green before the next:

1. **0.2 schema delta (F-B5/F-B4):** `common.schema.json` — `schemaVersion` `const "0.1"`→`enum ["0.1","0.2"]` (single-point; plan+initiative inherit via `$ref`); `evidence.testsCollected` + `evidence.mutation{target,change,killedBy[],killTranscript≤500}`; `kind:manual` optional `demoCommand/fallbackKind/steps/expected/data`. `initiative.schema.json` — `task.evidence` `$ref common.schema.json#/$defs/exitCriterion/properties/evidence` (note the `/properties/` segment). All additive-optional; `additionalProperties:false` intact. +6 tests.
2. **`migrate01to02` (F-B5):** exported in `src/migrate.js`, stamp-only (no backfill, no `normalizeEntity`), kind-agnostic, idempotent, throws on non-0.1. +7 tests.
3. **GATE-R2 (F-B2, the linchpin's teeth):** exported pure `checkMetInvariant(frontmatter)→string[]` in `validate-state.js`, wired always-on into `validateFile` after the Ajv pass. Enforces: `met` criterion / `done` task with a `shell|test|query` verifier ⟹ `evidence.passed===true` (+ `kind:test` `testsCollected>0`, + `kind:query` numeric `rowCount`); absent evidence = violation; `manual`/verifier-absent not gated. +11 tests incl. the 3 R-XAGENT-07 paranoid REDs (non-zero-exit / 0-tests / runner-not-found ≠ met) + the validateFile wiring test.
4. **Prose un-stub (`project-transitions.md`):** `kind:test` un-stubbed (real `{{BASH_TOOL}}` run behind y/N, exit-code + parsed `testsCollected`, met only on real pass, + optional G9 mutation-kill note); `kind:query` redefined DEFERRED-BY-DESIGN (killed the met-via-self-reported-rowCount path); evidence shape gains `testsCollected`+`mutation`; description-note workaround deleted in favor of `tasks[].evidence`. Strip-test (Inc0) confirms it stays Gemini-runnable.

**Suite:** 602 green (baseline 539 → +63 across Inc0+Inc1).

### ⚠️ GATE-R2 surfaced a real pre-existing state defect (NEEDS USER DECISION)

Wiring GATE-R2 made `node scripts/validate-state.js` (live tree) fail on **5 files / ~26 criteria** from the prior `aideck-multi-project` work — all marked `status: met` with `shell`/`test` verifiers but **no evidence block** (fabricated-met under the old stubbed regime). This matches [[project-aideck-multi-project-shipped]] ("F4+F5 code complete, gates pending manual verification"). The test suite stays green (fixtures are clean; no test validates the live tree). Affected:
`plans/aideck-multi-project.md` + `initiatives/aideck-multi-project-f{0,1,2,3}-*.md`.

This is the gate doing its job — these gates were closed without running their verifiers.

**RESOLVED (2026-06-01, user chose "re-verify now"):** ran each gate's verifier against the current aideck (`feat/aideck-v2-generic-runtime` — the multi-project work survived the rewrite). **24 of 26 criteria genuinely pass** with real tests (`register`:44, `projects`:11, `register validation`:4, `register idempotent`:2, `multi-watcher`:1, `unregister watcher`:1, `sse default project`:2, `watcher isolation`:1, `project-scoped state`:3, `backward-compat`:7, F3 serve.test.js:16) → recorded honest `evidence` (verifierKind:test, testsCollected, passed, outputSummary noting the branch). The gates were upgraded from `kind:shell`-wrapping-a-test to **`kind:test`** so GATE-R2's 0-tests guard protects them. Live tree validates again (17 files).

**Two caveats flagged for the user (NOT auto-fixed):**
- **F0-G3 (×2, plan + f0 initiative) → reverted to `pending`:** its verifier `-t 'health includes projects'` matches **0 tests** on v2 (everything skipped, `vitest` still exits 0 — the literal R-XAGENT-07 false-green). The behavior may be tested under a different name; the gate needs a corrected pattern or a real test before it can honestly be `met`. This is also why F0 phase-done is now technically optimistic (a done phase with one pending gate).
- **F3-G1 verifier is loose:** `node --test tests/serve.test.js` passes (16 tests) but `serve.test.js` has no test specifically for "ensureAideck registers B without killing A" — the run is a weak proxy for that criterion's stated behavior. Evidence recorded honestly; a targeted test would strengthen it.

Lesson worth carrying: **test-running gates should be `kind:test` (enforces `testsCollected>0`), never `kind:shell` wrapping a test command** — the shell form only checks exit code and silently passes a 0-tests run.

> Also fixed out-of-band (pre-existing, unrelated to Inc1): `initiatives/bmad-porting-research.md` had `references[3].kind: initiative`, invalid for `artifactRef` (enum `file|url|repo-path|section`) → corrected to `repo-path` (matches its in-repo path + `inside_repo:true`). Gitignored, not committed.

## Inc2 — layout JS-side (DONE)

Lands the `projects/<id>/<slug>/` tree so the first plan (the migration) can materialize there. The nested layout is **opt-in** (via `opts.projectId` / tree position) so the flat tree + all existing tests stay byte-identical during the coexistence window.

1. **decompose path-emit (R-MIG-04/05, F-D1):** `materializeDecomposition` gains `opts.projectId` (→ nested `<stateRoot>/projects/<id>/<slug>/{plan.md,phases/f<N>-*.md}`) and `opts.stateRoot` (default `.atomic-skills`, applies to BOTH layouts — the F-D1 redirectable root, **now actually wired** in decompose, closing correction #2 for the path-emit). Nested phase filenames drop the redundant `<planSlug>-` prefix (the dir encodes it); identity slug unchanged. Collision guard is per-call (per-plan) → same slug across two projects/plans never collides; two phases in one plan still throw. +7 tests.
2. **normalize walk (R-MIG-06/07):** `normalizeStateDir` also walks `projects/*/*/` (plan.md + phases/*.md incl. archive); `normalizeFile` kind-inference mirrors Inc0's `kindFromPath` (tree position). Flat loop intact. +1 test.
3. **serve enumeration (R-MIG-13/R-ORCH-26):** new exported `listProjects(stateRoot)` — folder name = projectId, on-disk source of truth replacing the in-memory ProjectRegistry; a project counts only with ≥1 `<slug>/plan.md`. `ensureAideck` untouched (the aiDeck **consumer** side is R-MIG-14, sequenced WITH the rewrite = Inc7). +3 tests.
4. **validate-state dir-walk (R-XAGENT-05 half):** `collectTargets` (now exported) walks `projects/*/*/` for a dir arg, so `validate-state <dir>` finds nested files (Inc0 `kindFromPath` already classifies them). +1 test.
5. **R-XAGENT-05 gitignore:** verified `git check-ignore` — the live `projects/*/*/source.md` is ALREADY ignored by the blanket `/.atomic-skills/` rule, so no redundant glob added. `project-create-plan.md` gains a layout-aware note: idempotent `source.md` ignore is only needed for a REDIRECTED root (F-D1 dogfood) or a git-tracked location (demo-fixtures negation).

**Suite:** 614 green (Inc0+Inc1+Inc2 = +75 over the 539 baseline). Live tree validates (17 files). The forward-declared `projects/atomic-skills/mode2-anthropic-subagent-tier/initiative.md` is a bare `initiative.md` (not plan.md/phases) → correctly skipped by the new walks; Inc6 migrate converts it to a degenerate 1-phase plan.

**Dogfood-leak guardrail UPDATE:** decompose now honors `opts.stateRoot`, so `materialize` CAN target a copy (`stateRoot: '.atomic-skills-dogfood'`). The guardrail tightens to: the skill body / dogfood driver MUST pass the redirected `stateRoot` (and `projectId`) — a bare `materialize` with neither still defaults to the live flat tree.

## Inc3 — DESIGN cognition (DONE)

Built conventionally (not on the migration critical path); to be replayed over the migration as a regression later (appendix 01 §5). Sequence: skill-authoring method FIRST, then the cognition, then the rewire.

1. **`docs/kb/skill-authoring.md` (R-SP-12) — the prerequisite.** The RED→GREEN→REFACTOR pressure-test method (repo-local form of T13, `docs/kb/analise-superpowers-v5.0.5.md:240-250`) + the 3+-combined-factor rule (`:249`) + the rented-phrasing exemption (rented verbatim from T01/T03/T04 = exempt; adapted/owned = full budget; cite-or-owe). Not catalog-registered, no Iron Law (a reference like code-quality-gates.md). The shippable artifact it mandates = the pressure-test record (`08-inc3-pressure-tests.md`).
2. **`skills/core/brainstorm.md` (R-SP-01/02) — the DESIGN engine.** B0 Frame → B1 Diverge (debate `--gate`, panel ONLY if ≥2 viable AND expensive-to-reverse) → B2 Decide (user ratifies, never the panel) → B3 Write `projects/<id>/<slug>/design.md` + lint → B4 critic gate (ceiling 3, never advance on Issues-Found) → B5 handoff to `project new plan`. Iron Law `NO PLAN WITHOUT AN APPROVED DESIGN` (HARD-GATE phrasing rented from T02). The DESIGN gate ladder (R-ORCH-16/17) lives in B1. Owned discipline blocks pressure-tested (see #6).
3. **`skills/shared/debate-assets/critic.md` (R-XAGENT-04 / F-C1) — the gate verdict.** Non-callable asset, header "NOT a debate persona; never resolved from roster.yaml" (the resolver only globs `.claude/agents/*.md` + `personas/*.md`, so it is never auto-resolved). Freshness contract (constructed-not-inherited context); tiered provider (same-provider-fresh → codex → solo-advisory); verify-before-fix. Emits the **codex pass-1 verdict shape** (`output-template-pass1.txt:7-13`, byte-identical across providers); **binary collapse**: Approved ⟺ `approve`/`approve_with_nits` AND zero blocker/critical, else Issues-Found.
4. **`skills/core/debate.md` `--gate` mode (R-SP-13/15/31).** Additive section after Orchestrator Synthesis: bounded agenda + mandatory per-round contrarian + machine-readable `ready_for_validation` Synthesis block, **handed to the critic** (R-SP-31) — debate is the ACTOR, never decides; `ready_for_validation:yes` ≠ approval. Iron Law preserved; non-gate behavior byte-unchanged. +1 Red-Flag + 1 Rationalization row (consensus-is-not-a-pass, R-ORCH-14). Catalog `--gate` flag added.
5. **`scripts/lint-design.js` (R-XAGENT-06) — the deterministic section lint.** Pure `lintDesignMd(markdown,{isMigration})→string[]` + `parseSections` (fence-aware, any heading level, case-insensitive) + CLI (`invokedDirectly` idiom mirroring validate-state.js). Requires `Decisions` + `Chosen approach` (+ `Blast radius` when `--migration`), each non-empty/non-placeholder. **+20 tests** (`tests/lint-design.test.js`). This gives R-ORCH-09 ("PLAN refuses without design.md") its testable teeth.
6. **`project-create-plan.md` rewire (R-ORCH-07/08/09, R-SP-27/28).** Stage 2 "Detect superpowers" → "DESIGN (brainstorm)"; Stage 3 → "Plan input source"; the "Superpowers integration" section → "DESIGN integration (brainstorm)" with brainstorm owning DESIGN and superpowers reduced to an optional detect-and-degrade RENT probe (exempt, R-SP-32). Stage 4 gains the **PLAN precondition**: `node scripts/lint-design.js …` HARD-BLOCKS decompose on a missing/failing design (the ad-hoc/single-task lanes and `adopt` are explicitly exempt). Tests in `project.test.js` updated to the new contract.

**Pressure-test (R-SP-03/08 — REQUIRED before ship), recorded in `08-inc3-pressure-tests.md`:** 9 combined-pressure scenarios (≥3 factors each) over brainstorm's owned blocks; round 1 found 4 gaps + 2 escape hatches; one REFACTOR round (additive Red-Flags + Rationalization rows) + a re-grade closed all → every scenario `countered=true`. **F-C1 critic falsifier:** the critic caught all 3 planted gaps in a migration design (`reject`/Issues-Found) and caught 2 fabricated `verified_by:` citations in the "clean" fixture — evidence-checking, not rubber-stamping (the false-alarm axis was not cleanly isolated because the fixture wasn't truly clean — noted).

**Schema/catalog:** `brainstorm` registered under `core:` (v2.2.0); `debate` `--gate` flag added; README + skills.generated.ts + skill docs regenerated; `validate-catalog` clean. **Suite: 640 green** (+26 over the 614 Inc2 baseline: +22 `lint-design`, +4 cross-agent strip coverage). Strip-test caught a real inline-`{{#if}}` bug in brainstorm.md (renderer regex needs block-form `}}\n…{{/if}}`) — fixed.

**Adversarial review (final gate before commit) — zero confirmed findings.** A 3-dimension review (canon conformance · gate-discipline integrity · lint-correctness + G1/G2/G6) with adversarial verify-per-finding returned `confirmed: []`. Most refuted findings invented a "skill body must back-cite the pressure-test record" convention that does not exist (citation flows record→skill; fix.md/hunt.md carry no such back-cite; the proposed `R-SP-12` cite would be fabricated). Two refuted findings were verified by hand anyway and acted on: (a) `lint-design.js` `normalizeHeading` stripped `_` to empty, false-blocking a snake_case heading (`## Chosen_approach`) on a hard-block gate → fixed to `_`→space (+2 tests); (b) one G2 `may`→`can` in the create-plan RENT-probe text. No live `.atomic-skills/` writes (Inc3 is cognition, off the migration path).

## Next (Inc4)

No-Placeholders lint (R-ORCH-12/R-SP-24, deterministic zero-token reject of TODO/REPLACE_*/fuzzy paths in `decompose.js` before materialize) + SPEC gate (R-ORCH-11/19/23, per-task interior in the existing schema, no new keys). The design.md section lint (Inc3) and the No-Placeholders lint share the deterministic-lint substrate.

## SESSION HANDOFF — resume at Inc4 (2026-06-01)

**Read order for the resuming session:** this block → `00-CANON.md` RESUME HERE → `00-CANON.md` decision log + build order (Inc4 rung) → this file top-to-bottom (the 5 ground-truth corrections + Inc0–Inc3 detail) → `01-…§2.5` + `§3 WF-SPEC` (R-ORCH-11/12/19/23, R-SP-24/25) → `02-superpowers-extraction.md` §3 (the No-Placeholders/per-task-rigor extract).

### Narrative (where we are)
project→lifecycle-orchestrator: design decision-complete; **Inc0+Inc1+Inc2+Inc3 built & committed** on `dogfood/self-host-migration` (off `main`). The enforcement spine (strip-test gate, nested-layout kind inference, GATE-R2 met-invariant, 0.2 schema, `projects/<id>/<slug>/` plumbing) AND the DESIGN cognition (brainstorm B0–B5, the actor-critic gate, debate `--gate`, the `design.md` section lint, the create-plan rewire) are done. Inc3 was built OFF the migration critical path and pressure-tested (record in `08-inc3-pressure-tests.md`); no destructive writes to the live `.atomic-skills/` tree.

### State (verbatim)
- Branch: `dogfood/self-host-migration` (base `main`). **Working tree CLEAN** (this handoff is the only pending doc edit, committed separately).
- Commits (newest first): `4d61594` Inc3 · `a996371` Inc2 · `d182047` re-verify doc · `ab4b9dc` Inc1 · `febe267` Inc0. (`main` tip before this work: `7500822`.)
- Suite: `npm test` → **640 pass / 0 fail** (Inc2 baseline 614; +22 `lint-design`, +4 strip coverage). Strip-test 72/72. `validate-catalog` clean.
- Live tree: `node scripts/validate-state.js` → **All 17 file(s) valid** (schemaVersion 0.1/0.2) — untouched by Inc3.
- Memory updated: [[project-orchestrator-redesign-canon]] (now Inc0–Inc3), MEMORY.md index.

### Single nextAction
Start **Inc4 — No-Placeholders lint + SPEC gate** (R-ORCH-12/R-SP-24 first — it is the deterministic backstop the thin task bodies depend on). Enforce in `decompose.js` (or a sibling, mirroring `scripts/lint-design.js`'s pure-fn+CLI shape): reject `TODO`/`REPLACE_*`/fuzzy `<path>` refs **before** `materializeDecomposition` writes — abort with a named error, 0 files written. **decompose format UNCHANGED** (R-ORCH-10: `## F0/F1` + `### Tn` + `exit_gate` YAML). Note `decompose.test.js:293` confirms materialize today *generates* TODO sentinels; the lint must reject them pre-write.

### Inc4 build order
1. **No-Placeholders lint (R-ORCH-12/R-SP-24)** — enforced, deterministic, zero-token; reject TODO/REPLACE_*/fuzzy paths + "similar to Task N" / undefined-type refs pre-materialize. Mirror `lint-design.js` (pure `lintSource()→string[]` + wired into the decompose materialize path). RED tests first.
2. **Enrich `minimal-source.template.md` (R-SP-25)** — per-task Files block + RED-GREEN checklist.
3. **SPEC / per-task gate (R-ORCH-11/19/23)** — per-task interior in the EXISTING `initiative.schema.json` fields (description + acceptance[≤5] + scopeBoundary[] + verifier), NO new keys; SPEC gate = No-Placeholders lint + `review-plan` ambiguity checks, **no panel**; no task admitted to SPEC without exact paths + scopeBoundary[] + a deterministic verifier (named error otherwise).
- Wire the SPEC gate into `project-create-plan.md` Stage 5/6 (the lint already aborts materialize; the per-task hard gate is the admission check).

### Critical constraints carried forward (do NOT violate)
- **R-XAGENT-01 strip-test is live** — new/edited skill bodies use tool-abstraction template vars only; any CC-only host tool inside `{{#if ide.claude-code}}` (block form: `}}` then newline, or the renderer regex misses it — bit me in Inc3). `tests/compatibility.test.js` enforces it.
- **Pressure-test record required** before any NEW owned Iron Law/Red-Flag/Rationalization block ships (R-SP-03/08, R-EXEC-31): ≥3 combined-pressure scenarios (≥3 factors each), dated, cited — method in `docs/kb/skill-authoring.md`; record per increment (e.g. a `09-…` file). Inc4 is mostly deterministic lint (likely no new discipline block → no budget), but the SPEC gate's refusal language, if it grows a Rationalization block, owes the budget.
- **Catalog/doc drift blocks the commit** — the husky pre-commit runs `generate-docs` + `validate-catalog`; stage the regenerated README + `skills.generated.ts` + `docs/skills/*` together. No new core skill in Inc4 (decompose.js + template + gate only), so likely no catalog change.
- **Dogfood-leak guardrail still active** — do NOT run `decompose materialize` against the live tree without a redirected `opts.stateRoot`; the Inc4 lint should be exercised on fixtures/throwaway, not the live `.atomic-skills/`.

### Open caveats carried forward (flagged, user-deferred — NOT blockers)
- **F0-G3 (×2) pending** in the live aideck-multi-project state: verifier `-t 'health includes projects'` matches 0 tests on aideck@`feat/aideck-v2-generic-runtime`. Fix the `-t` pattern or add a real test before it can honestly be `met`. (F0 phase is technically optimistic — done phase, one pending gate.)
- **F3-G1 loose verifier:** `node --test tests/serve.test.js` passes but has no test specifically for "ensureAideck registers B without killing A". A targeted test would strengthen it.

### Resume hygiene (the design's own `resume` refuses on these)
Tree is clean and there are no TODO placeholders in this handoff, so a fresh session may proceed. If anything is dirty on resume, stash/commit before starting Inc4. Optionally open a PR for the branch first (`gh pr create`) if you want review before Inc4 — ask the user; not done automatically.
